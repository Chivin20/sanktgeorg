                        The common rooms are open and equipped with satellite television and many indoor games for students during their free time. 
                        While weekend activities are designed to be fun, they are also educative and sometimes challenging. We place a high premium on hygiene. 
                        That is why we maintain a quality laundry service where uniforms for students are washed and ironed, 
                        while also encouraging them to wash their underwear and nightwear themselves.
