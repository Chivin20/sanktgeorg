                        FUTO, as the Oldest University of Technology in Nigeria, was established in 1980 by Executive fiat with the 
                        composition and appointment of the first provisional Council by Nigeria’s First Executive President, Shehu Shagari. 
                        It became the first of three such Universities set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria who sought to establish a 
                        University of Technology in each geo-political region and particularly 
                        in a State which did not have a conventional University.
                        <br>
                        FUTO is surrounded by a number of autonomous communities and homesteads all of which had contributed land acquired for the development of the University. 
                        These communities are Ihiagwa, Obinze, Umuoma, Nekede, Eziobodo, Avu, Okolochi, Obibiezena, and Emeabiam.  It is bisected by a new road between Obinze and Naze which connects the two mentioned major roads. 
                        The Otamiri River traverses the site from North to South and with the beautiful vegetation in its river basin forms an important physical feature.
